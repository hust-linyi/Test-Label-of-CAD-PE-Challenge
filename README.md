# Test Label of CAD-PE Challenge

### Introduction
Here's the labels of CAD-PE Challenge test set. In our [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-32251-9_31), 'Automated Pulmonary Embolism Detection from CTPA Images Using an End-to-End Convolutional Neural Network', we compared our PE detection network with the methods on the PE challenge test set. As the ground truth labels are not available on the website, we asked a radiologist with over 10 yearsâ€™ reading experience to manually delineate PEs in each test scan. The manual annotations were further validated by a 2nd observer. Now we release our manual annotations for fair comparison in the future studies.
